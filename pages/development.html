        <h4>Project Launch</h4>
        <h6><em>Date posted: 07/10/18</em></h6>
        <p>Welcome to Team 9’s first blog post! This development blog will introduce our task of creating an adventure game to showcase to our peers. After the group was set up, we began by creating a Designed Alliance which highlighted our commitments to one another and what we wanted our team environment to be like (open, honest, challenging etc.). We spent our first official meeting discussing possible ideas for the game and whether we wanted to create a 2D game or a 3D game. In the end, we decided to combine two game ideas, one being a rendition of the video game Brothers and the other being the story of Hachiko the dog.</p>

        <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
        <p>This week, we discussed our vision for the game and recorded and submitted our video pitch for our game. We decided to go with a voice-over video instead of a sit-down video as we felt it would be more unique and would allow us to show our initial designs for our game.</p>

        <h4>Team Roles</h4>
        <h6><em>Date posted: 20/10/2018</em></h6>
        <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
        <p>This blog post will discuss our team roles and how we came about them with the help of Belbin’s team roles. We first began by each expressing our strengths and weaknesses in relation to the project objectives and then using this knowledge to assign roles. For the Video Pitch we mainly focused on the storyline, art and music aspect of the game so the first sub-teams that were created was the Art team and the Music team. Both teams needed to research the designs and audio we would be using throughout the game and the many levels and chapters.

        <h4>Hacking Away</h4>
        <h6><em>Date posted: 08/11/18</em></h6>
        <p>It was now time to get down to business on one of our bigger submissions; The Hack! Every member of the group at this point had the latest version of Android Studio downloaded and cloned the latest project via Gitlab. We began by focusing on the designing process of the Hack milestone, specifically the UML diagrams. The group split up into more manageable sub-teams to work on the various diagrams of the C4 model that we had to illustrate and they consisted of the following:

                <li>Mahnoor</li>
              </ul>

              <ul style="list-style-type:none">

                <li>Alex</li>
                <li>Ehsaan</li>
              </ul>

              <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                <li>Jay</li>
                <li>Ashley</li>
                <li>Jovin</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          We also have been working on the documentation aspect of the Hack which consists of a project plan that highlights our vision and how we plan to achieve it. The project plan laid out our team roles, the milestones and deadlines we had set out as well as the high-level description of the architecture of our system.</p>

        <h4>The Hack</h4>
        <h6><em>Date posted: 08/11/18</em></h6>
        <p>The hack was quite a crucial starting point of creating our game. For the hack we had to create the basis of our game, demonstrating how feasible it is to create based around what was mentioned of in the video pitch.

        <br />The core idea had to be focused within the game, this meaning it should demonstrate movement and the main features such as using weapons to interacting with the player. This was quite tricky of where to start therefore, we went for the peer-programming approach for members that are not as confident in programming in order to split the team into sub-groups this allowing each group or confident individuals to work on a specific elements to implement.

        <br />Once the core concepts of the game was near enough to being finished we needed to create a screencast of our game in order to show it off in an engaging way. This entails the players abilities to how they navigate through the map.</p>

        <h4>Further Development</h4>
        <h6><em>Date posted: 15/11/18</em></h6>
        <p>Once the hack was out of the way, we were able to get feedback on our hack from two critics and this followed in two parts; the idea of our game and then the actual code that was written and how the mechanics work.

        <br />The first critic gave us his thoughts on our pitch, he thought that it is moving in the right direction and the development was at a good pace within this stage. He did feel as though we needed some way to potentially add story to keep interest, which we intend to do in future development. The second critic thought that the way we structured the code and elements we used worked well, there were parts within the code that needed tweaking as the development becomes more complex.

        <br />As a group we took this feedback and ensured that we took the feedback on board in order to ensure that we polish our game for the MVP. This is going to be tense work but we shall keep you posted on the progression of how our game is evolving!</p>
